* Universal References

** Introduction

The idea of Universal References (URs) is to *abstract over the origin* of data to have a single representation for all possibilities.

- IPLD

** Data sources

- Git repository
- Server
- Database
- ISBN

** Scratch space

It may be a good idea to have our language also be available in URs: Suppose we have some data representing source code from origin ~o~ and a function ~compile~ that compiles the source code, then ~compile o~ would also be an UR of a compiled program. Note that ~compile~ should also take arguments for architecture, etc.
