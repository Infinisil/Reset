* Reset

** Introduction

This will become a place where I put all my ideas I have for how computing systems could work if we wouldn't have to care about backwards compatibility and could start fresh with the knowledge of all the things we have learned ever since.

** Todo
*** Meta
 
- Maybe change project name (Reset/MovingOn/Future)
- Maybe needs a project website (Jekyll + GitHub Pages, custom domain)
- Which license to use
- How to do collaboration & contribution
- Project organization: Use GitHub Projects for tracking state of ideas? Wiki page?
- Abbreviation dictionary?

*** General

- Detailed explanation
- Priorities (design first, compatibility second)
- Discuss other projects that are connected ([[https://ipfs.io][IPFS]], [[https://github.com/ipld/specs][IPLD]], [[https://nixos.org][NixOS]], [[https://www.idris-lang.org][Idris]], [[http://orgmode.org][Org Mode]], [[https://zeronet.io][Zeronet]], [[https://www.ethereum.org][Ethereum]])
- Generalizing over feature set
- What is the end product? An entire OS?
- Potentially define timeline, milestones, goals

*** Ideas to elaborate

- Unified dependency and cache management
- Decentralization
- Type-driven
- User vs. program generated
- Direct syntax tree editing
- ACLs
- Universal references, CID, IPLD, URIs
- Continuous update machanism
- Conform semantic versioning
- Integrated StackExchange-like platform
- Examples, tutorials, docs, etc. linked directly to the relevant code
- Change-tracking diffs, Precision vs. Size
- Protocol/specification oriented (protocol-protocol?)
- Global name register against ambiguity
